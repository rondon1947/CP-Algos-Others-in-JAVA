/*Coding Blocks
Take the following as input.

A number (N1)
A number (N2)
Write a function which returns the GCD of N1 and N2. Print the value returned.



Input Format
Two integers seperated by a new line.

Constraints
0 < N1 < 1000000000
0 < N2 < 1000000000

Output Format
Output a single integer which is the GCD of the given integers.

Sample Input
16
24
Sample Output
8
Explanation
The largest number that divides both N1 and N2 is called the GCD of N1 and N2.*/
